## About

> details in next commit.

The project contains a prototype (mobile-only) website. The major part of project is the game.

Team Members:

- Akshay Yadav
- Rishija Mangla

To run, start a local server in the downloaded folder, and view the app in browser. The design, at the time of this submission, is to be viewed comfortably in a mobile device (It'll run in any resolution, but weirdly). S view the website in a mobile or emulate the mobile ([how to emulate mobile device in Google Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/)).

Python example,

``` bash
~/zoohackathon $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Node.js example: (run `npm i -g live-server`)

``` bash
~/zoohackathon $ live-server
```
